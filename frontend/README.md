# AstroPedia - Frontend

This is the frontend for the AstroPedia application. Tech stack includes [React](https://react.dev/), and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## Requirements

- Node 18.0.0 or later (see [checking the Node version](#checking-the-nodejs-version))

## Checking the Node.js version

To check which Node version you have, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If the command doesn't return a version, you might not have Node installed.

You can go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and set up Node (`v18.0.0` or later) on your machine. If you use a version manager for Node, use it to install Node 18.

Once you install node, run `node -v` again to confirm the version. You might need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

## Running the frontend locally

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone [this repository]
   ```

   or if you have a forked version:

   ```bash
   git clone [your forked version]
   ```

2. Navigate to the root directory.

   ```bash
   cd [this repository]
   ```

3. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

4. Install the Node dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Confirm that a backend is running

6. Start the frontend client.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
